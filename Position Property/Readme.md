# CSS Position Property Guide

## Introduction

The CSS `position` property allows you to control the positioning of elements on a web page. Understanding how to use the `position` property is essential for creating layouts and designs that are visually appealing and functional.

This guide will cover the different values of the `position` property (`static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`), how each value affects the positioning of elements, and examples of when to use each value.

## Values of the `position` property

1. `static`: This is the default value of the `position` property. Elements with `position: static;` are positioned according to the normal flow of the document. `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties have no effect on statically positioned elements.

2. `relative`: Elements with `position: relative;` are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow. Using `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties will offset the element from its normal position.

3. `absolute`: Elements with `position: absolute;` are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the `<html>` element or the viewport).

4. `fixed`: Elements with `position: fixed;` are positioned relative to the viewport. They remain fixed in their position even when the page is scrolled.

5. `sticky`: Elements with `position: sticky;` are positioned based on the user's scroll position. It is treated as `position: relative;` until it reaches a specified scroll position, then it is treated as `position: fixed;`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Static Position

```css
.static {
  position: static;
}
```

### Example 2: Relative Position

```css
.relative {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
}
```

### Example 3: Absolute Position

```css
.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
}
```

### Example 4: Fixed Position

```css
.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}
```

### Example 5: Sticky Position

```css
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

The `position` property in CSS is a powerful tool for controlling the layout and positioning of elements on a web page. By understanding how each value of the `position` property works, you can create more dynamic and visually appealing designs.
