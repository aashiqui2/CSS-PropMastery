      <!-- notice how item 4 is smaller than the others that because the implicit grid doesn't inherit the values that we set in the grid template rows and grid template columns properties -->

      <!-- we can use grid-auto-rows  property on our container, what this does is set the size of the rows on any implicit grid that gets whne i created set it to 100 pixels, now our implicit grid has a row of 100 pixels. -->
      <!-- By default our implicit grid added a row but we can change this grid autoflow property and set it to column -->
      <!-- now any implicit grid that gets created will be created as a column instead with column being the new default for our implicit grids we can use  grid auto columns to define the size of those columns and set it to 100px  -->
